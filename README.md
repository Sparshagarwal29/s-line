# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

SO, this is something which is realted to "S-Line" concept of a k-drama, 
hat i did is , simplely catureing the photo,
for the camera acces i used   "  navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true } " ---> this help me get the meadia acces 
then through the canvas and getContext I can make the user give me their image data .
then that image is given to img tag and boom the image is on the laptop 

# tho it some improvemnt like 
--> picture qualtiy can be improved
--> camera size 
--> error handling 

would improve all this in version 2
